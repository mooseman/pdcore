ACKNOWLEDGEMENT - As the new maintainer of pdcore (as of 13th Sep 2012),  
I want to acknowledge the good work that the previous maintainer (Patrick Vessey) 
has put into this project. Very many thanks for your work, Patrick.  

The original README for pdcore follows -  
********************************************************************* 

DESCRIPTION
  pdcore is a POSIX.1-2008 compliant public domain implementation of the
  core *NIX file, shell and text manipulation utilities.

  This utility set differs from existing implementations in one (or both)
  of two key aspects:

    (1) It is placed entirely within the public domain. See the file
        UNLICENSE for further details.

    (2) It aims to achieve strict adherence to POSIX.1-2008. Note that
        this does NOT imply any endorsement of pdcore by The Open Group.

  At a practical level, pdcore can be used as a drop-in replacement for
  the near-ubiquitous GNU core utility suite. Unlike the latter, pdcore
  is truly free, respects *nix standards, is vastly smaller, and generally
  doesn't suck ass.

  Whilst coded and tested on i686 Linux, pdcore ought to compile and run on
  any POSIX.1-compliant *nix operating system with an ANSI C compiler. The
  project maintainer would be especially interested in feedback from users
  of other platforms, and any issues that they might experience (e.g. should
  endianness causes a problem).


PROJECT STATUS 
  As of 13th Sep 2012 - Andy Elvey is now the maintainer of pdcore, taking over 
this role from Patrick Vessey.
