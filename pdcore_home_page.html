<h2>What?</h2>
<p>The pdcore project aims to produce a
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">POSIX.1-2008</a>
compliant public domain implementation of the core
UNIX<sup><a href="#footer">1</a></sup> file, shell and text manipulation
utilities.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Existing implementations (proprietary <em>and</em> FOSS) suffer from one or both
of two key problems:</p>
<ol><li><p>They are <a href="#freedom">not truly free</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Having added all manner of superfluous cruft, some other implementations
have long drifted away from <a href="#unixway">the guiding design principles
of UNIX systems</a>. This has resulted in bloated and talkative utilities,
and a loss of the user value that having an easily remembered set of clean,
simple tools originally
provided.</p></li></ol>
<h2>Where?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mooseman/pdcore">project homepage</a>
 is located on GitHub.</p>
<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>Sources for the utilities and their associated man pages will be added to
the project as they are released or updated. As the maintainer has less free
time to code than he'd like, releases are expected to be slow without assistance.

<h2>Free (as in Honestly Free)</h2>
<p>There's a lot of garbage talked about 'freedom' on the web and, sadly,
it's frequently the most vocal who seem to least well understand the concept.
So, what is freedom?</p>
<p><em>Freedom is the absence of coercion and constraint<sup><a href="#footer">2</a></sup>.</em></p>
<p>A simple concept that we can all grasp, so why do organisations like the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> insist on qualifying
the word with terms such as 'free as in beer' or 'free as in speech'? Maybe
it's because they truly don't understand that genuine freedom is non-coercive,
or maybe it's to distract you from remembering that yourself?</p>
<p>At heart, a software license &#8212; any software license &#8212; is a legal
assertion of ownership. It exists to formally state that you, the recipient of
the software, don't truly own it; rather that the copyright holders do. Those
rights holders may then use the license to grant you various concessions
in respect of their software, like whether you have permission to access the
source code, whether they will permit you to modify it and redistribute
the changed code, and so on.</p>
<p>The level of perceived benevolence may vary dramatically between
licenses for proprietary software and those widely used within the FOSS
community, but any distinctions are purely illusory. To claim that a document,
the fundamental purpose of which is to legally restrict your freedom, should be
celebrated for guaranteeing 'free' access to source code or 'free'
redistribution rights is total sophistry. You might just as well celebrate the
'free' accommodation and 'free' meals that you would receive whilst serving a
prison sentence; in both cases, doing so would be overlooking the bigger
impact on your true freedom.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to software released under restrictive licenses (and,
again, there can be no other kind), code placed into the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a> is
irrevocably, permanently and honestly free. By dedicating their work to the
public domain, software authors relinquish any claims of ownership over their
code, and make it freely available for anyone to use in any manner that
they may choose. With no claims on ownership, and no restrictions on use,
public domain code is the only software that meets the basic requirement
needed to be called truly free &#8212; a guaranteed absence of coercion. Authors
of public domain code cannot tell you what to do with the software (because,
unlike licensed code, it no longer belongs to them), nor can they use
the legal process to forcibly coerce you to obey their wishes or demands.</p>
<p>Some disdain the public domain as offering too much freedom. They
point out that there is nothing to stop copies of code therein being used in
a manner that they don't approve of, or even being placed under license by
another party. That's perfectly true &#8212; <em>copies</em> of public domain
works can be. But the original code always stays truly free, and it would be
a funny kind of 'freedom' that stopped people from acting as they wished.
For authoritarians everywhere, though, 'free speech' means only that you
are able to say what <em>they</em> want you to, not necessarily what
<em>you</em> might want to.</p>
<p>The source code of the pdcore utilities is placed into the public domain
through the <a href="http://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a>. If the code is
useful to you, you may do whatever you wish with it. No restrictions, no
coercion, and no license compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Just honest and irrevocable freedom.</p>

<h2>The UNIX Way</h2>
<p>The success of UNIX over the last
<a href="http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html">40 years</a>
can be attributed to many factors, but it is commonly accepted that the
design philosophy underpinning the system,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">the UNIX way</a>,
has been key.</p>
<p>In the context of userland utilities, exhortations such as "<em>write
programs that do one thing and do it well</em>", "<em>silence is golden</em>"
and "<em>design for simplicity</em>" initially led to a well rounded suite of
user utilities that were efficient and productive.</p>
<p>The obvious benefit for the user in having one good tool to do each
particular job is that they find it easy to remember which tool is appropriate
for any given task. However, and even from the early days of UNIX, as
<a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/cat-v/">this paper</a> by Pike and
Kernighan illustrates, probably well meaning &#8212; but definitely ignorant
&#8212; people began abusing the philosophy that made UNIX what it was,
with dire consequences. Sadly, the feature bloat and the resultant user
confusion discussed by Pike and Kernighan carried on unabated, and is largely
responsible for the commonly held view of those new to UNIX and
Linux<sup><a href="#footer">3</a></sup> systems that the command line is a
frightening and difficult place to be. And they frequently have a point.</p>
<p>Old-time UNIX users remember that things weren't always this way, but the
poor souls who have recently come to *nix systems due to the recent growth
in the use of Linux and its GNU-infested userland frequently end up thinking
that ugly, bloated code and user confusion are simply part and parcel of
the *nix experience.</p>
<p>Whilst standards bodies frequently receive well deserved criticism, those
responsible for the POSIX specification of the standard UNIX utilities deserve
a little more credit. Although still too fat for some tastes, their counsel
on system utilities is far closer to the spirit of the UNIX way than is commonly
encountered in many modern implementations. You won't find the infamous
<em>cat&nbsp;-v</em> in POSIX.1-2008, much less the frankly ridiculous
<em>cat&nbsp;-n</em>; rather, the user is recommended to use the <em>nl</em>
(number lines) utility if that is the tool that they need.</p>
<p>The pdcore project aims to provide a complete, correct and
copyright-free implementation of the POSIX.1-2008 utility set, with no added
bells, whistles or go-faster stripes. Whilst the project maintainer would
personally have preferred an even sparser set of utilities, code that is
never used is useless; consequently, strict adherence to the relatively
minimalist standard was considered preferable to encourage adoption.</p>
<p>It is hoped that if you've spent your *nix life fighting with obscure and
crufty utility sets, from GNU and others, that pdcore will help to make your
command line existence simpler, more pleasant, and a damn-sight more productive
&#8212; as that really is <em>the UNIX way</em>.

</p><h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>The project aims to implement all of the non development-oriented
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html">
POSIX.1-2008 shell and utilities</a>, moving on for full coverage if possible.
This is obviously a fairly large undertaking, and any assistance would be
very welcome.</p>
<p>If you want to submit code, it would be appreciated if you could work
to the coding conventions used in the released source. However, the maintainer
is willing to refactor/rewrite submissions, so that a coherent and
consistent codebase is maintained.</p>
<p>As code will be placed into the public domain, all submissions <em>must</em>
be accompanied by an email &#8212; preferably digitally signed &#8212;
